# String Signal Analysis

This project presents a comparative signal analysis of three string instruments (violin, guitar, and bass) using Fourier Transform and Cubic Spline Interpolation methods. Fourier analysis was employed to identify dominant frequency components, while cubic spline interpolation was used to reconstruct and smooth the discrete waveform data. The results highlight the unique harmonic structures and tonal differences among the instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining interpolation and frequency-domain analysis for digital signal characterization.

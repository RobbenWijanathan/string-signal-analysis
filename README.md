# Comparative Signal Analysis of String Instruments

This project analyzes the signals of three string instruments (violin, guitar, bass) using Fourier Transform and Cubic Spline Interpolation. Fourier analysis is used to identify dominant frequency components, while cubic spline interpolation is applied to smooth and reconstruct discrete waveform data.

The results show distinct harmonic structures and tonal differences across the instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining interpolation and frequency-domain analysis for digital signal characterization.

## Methods
- Fourier Transform for frequency component identification  
- Cubic Spline Interpolation for waveform reconstruction

## Instruments
- Violin
